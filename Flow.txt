Key points:

Only invited clients (added by designer) can sign up.
Signup only sets password in credentials.
No duplicate or unauthorized accounts possible.

Here’s an explanation of the client invite and signup flow based on your backend (server.js) and the overall architecture:

1. Designer Invites a Client
The designer uses the app to add a new client.
The backend:
Adds the client to the clients collection (with fields like designer_id, email, etc.).
Adds a record to the credentials collection with the client’s email, id, role: "client", but no password.
Result:
The client now exists in both clients and credentials (but cannot log in yet).

2. Client Signup
The client receives an invite (or is told by the designer to sign up).
The client goes to the signup page and enters their email and password.
What happens in the backend:
The frontend calls POST /clients/signup with { email, password }.
The backend:
Checks if the email exists in the credentials collection with role: "client".
If not: Responds with an error: "You are not invited. Contact your designer."
Checks if a password is already set for this email.
If yes: Responds with an error: "Account already exists. Please login."
If both checks pass, sets the password for this credentials record.
The client can now log in using their email and password.
3. Client Login
The client logs in using their email and password.
The backend checks the credentials collection for a matching email, role, and password.
4. Security & Integrity
Only invited clients (those added by a designer) can sign up.
Clients cannot create their own client record—they must be invited.
Clients cannot sign up twice—once a password is set, signup is blocked for that email.
If a client is deleted, their credentials are also deleted.
Summary Table
Step	Collection(s) affected	Who can do it?	What happens?
Designer adds client	clients, credentials	Designer	Client is added (no password in credentials)
Client signs up	credentials	Client	Password is set if invited and not already registered
Client logs in	credentials	Client	Login allowed if email and password match
Client deleted	clients, credentials	Admin/Designer	Client and their credentials are removed
This flow ensures only invited clients can sign up and log in, and prevents duplicate or unauthorized accounts.
